            <h2 id="week1">Week 7: Patriots vs Jets</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Jets running game</h1>
            <p>The Patriots run an old school 3-4 front in which both defensive ends and nose tackle use a 2 gap technique. Inside, the two linebackers are tasked with getting downhill to fill both the A and B gaps against base runs, and the linebackers on the outside are tasked with playing contain. The Patriots have gotten superb contributions from everyone along the defensive line as well as their linebackers in the running game.</p>
            <p>The New York Jets' running game has been anemic through the first six weeks of the season, and it begins with the poor play of their offensive line. They made several changes over the off-season in an attempt to fix this position group, but it is clear that they have not yet been able to gel. The Kalil signing has not worked out as expected, and their OL has exhibited miscommunication and just overall subpar performances. As they continue to work together, it's possible that they may improve, but they will have their hands full with a stout New England defensive front.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Jets pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Jets' OL struggles extend to the pass protection, as was the case in the first game between these two squads.</p>
            <p>The Patriots' versatile front 7 has been able to generate pressure from a variety of areas. Their defensive tackles, defensive ends, and linebackers, have all contributed to a strong pass rush. The creativity in their pass rush schemes, which is something we saw a lot of in the second half of last season, has been on display in the first two weeks of 2019.From simulated pressure, to stunts, to disguised blitzes, the Patriots have been able to keep opponents on their toes.</p>
            <p>Rookie DE Chase Winovich has played extremely well, and has seemingly already mastered the complicated Patriots playbook. They've entrusted him with significant playing time, and he has not disappointed. He's only going to get better with more experience.</p>
            <p>Jamie Collins, in his second stint as a Patriot, looks to be a more mature player, and has been a very valuable piece of this defense. His speed as a pass rushers has already paid dividends, and he will be a handful for the Jets on Monday.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Jets passing game</h1>
            <p>The Jets run a West Coast / Air Coryell hybrid scheme. They use a lot of motion and they like to target the defense's weakness with precise route combinations. Adam Gase also likes to us formations in which the TE is isolated in order to create matchup advantages for his offense. He also frequently uses his RBs as part of the passing attack.</p>
            <p>The Jets' WR duo of Jamison Crowder and Robby Anderson has played fairly well considering the struggles of the offense. However, beyond that, they have not received much production from their WRs. Newly acquired RB, Le'Veon Bell has been used effectively as a receiver, and will no doubt receive a lot of attention from the Patriots' defense.</p>
            <p>New England's secondary continues where it left off at the end of last season. They've been very dominant. Their defensive backs are so versatile, which allows them to play different positions, not only from game to game, but from play to play. This makes it difficult for the opposing offense to diagnose what the defense is doing. The Patriots play a lot of man coverage, especially Cover 1, but as we saw in Super Bowl 53, they can go zone heavy if the matchup calls for it.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Jets run defense</h1>
            <p>The Jets, much like the Patriots, run a 3-4 defense. Their run defense in 2019 has been solid, and CJ Mosley, who is their best defender, is likely to play this time around.</p>
            <p>The Patriots run game has not been as dominant this season as it was down the stretch in 2018. A lot of that has to do with injuries across the offensive line. Center David Andrews was lost for the season and replaced by Ted Karras. Karras had some ups and downs in week 1, but overall he has looked good, and he will get even better as he develops more chemistry with Brady. Marcus Cannon went down in week 1, and has been playing hurt. Isaiah Wynn has been placed on IR with the possibility of returning in week 8.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Jets.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Jets pass rush</h1>
            <p>The Jets' pass rush has looked better in recent weeks than at the start of the season. The injuries they've dealt with may have been responsible for the slow start, but the lack of creativity in their pass rush schemes did not do them any favors, either. However, they look better now, and the addition of CJ Mosley will help as well.</p>
            <p>The Patriots offensive line continues to be inconsistent when it comes to protecting Tom Brady. They will have their hands full on Monday night.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Jets.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Jets pass defense</h1>
            <p>The Jets secondary has held its own this season, but they are susceptible to giving up big plays in the passing game. Trumaine Johnson seems to be struggling, but Nate Hairston and Darryl Roberts has been solid on the outside. Safety Jamal Adams is an elite player as well.</p>
            <p>The Patriots head into Monday night's showdown without Josh Gordon, Rex Burkhead, Matt LaCosse, and Ryan Izzo. Julian Edelman and Phillip Dorsett are both questionable. They will most likely play, but are both playing hurt. Needless to say, the Patriots won't have an easy time passing the ball. Veteran TE Ben Watson should have plenty of opportunities Monday night to show what he has left.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
