            <h2 id="week1">Week 4: Dolphins vs Patriots</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Dolphins running game</h1>
            <p>For the second consecutive week, the Patriots' run defense, particularly the defensive line, turned in a very disappointing performance. Danny Shelton was the biggest culprit and the weakest player along the defensive line. It's almost not even fair to blame the linebackers, as the defensive line has allowed the opposition to control the gaps and easily get to the second level over the last couple of weeks. Although Hightower has once again looked like a shell of his former self. He looks slow and has had trouble setting the edge, which has paved the way to big runs to the outside. So the linebackers aren't without blame. The front 7 needs to do a much better job of getting off blocks and winning one on one battles. The performance against the Lions was very concerning, because they got dominated by one of the weakest running games in the league. Prior to Sunday's game, the Lions OL looked weak in run blocking, and beyond Kerryon Johnson, their RBs had not looked impressive. </p>
            <p>The Dolphins did not look good running the ball against the Raiders, or in the prior two weeks for that matter, but playing this struggling New England run defense might be just what they need to get back on track. </p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Dolphins.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Dolphins pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Patriots' pass rush didn't look much better than their run defense. They sacked Stafford once, but he was barely under duress for most of the night. He was allowed to sit back and pick apart the New England secondary at will. The Lions OL had been struggling in pass protection, too, which made this effort (or lack thereof) even more perplexing.  </p>
            <p>Ryan Tannehill has been sacked 6 times through the first 3 games of the season, with 4 of those coming in the week 2 game against the Jets. The loss of their big off-season acquisition, LG Josh Sitton, definitely hurts, but they have looked solid. Even in the week 2 game against the Jets, two of those sacks surrendered were arguably not the offensive line's fault. Miami has had serious issues with pass protection in recent years, so it will be interesting to see if they revert to their old ways. But for now, they have looked solid.</p>
            <p>Something to consider is the fact that this will be New England's first home game since the season opener. The pass rush looked very strong that game, albeit against what many consider to be the worst OL in the league. However, part of it was also due to homefield advantage. It's much harder for the offense to adjust pass protection assignments pre-snap on the road, given the crowd noise. </p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Dolphins.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Dolphins passing game</h1>
            <p>Matt Patricia coached his team to a win over his former employer on Sunday night, with a dominant performance on both sides of the ball. Having been a defensive coordinator, it was at least somewhat expected that his defense would be prepared for the New England offense, having coached against that unit in practice for years. One of the more interesting aspects of the game, however, was his knowledge of the New England defense and how it benefited the Lions' offense. Patricia used his knowledge of the Patriots' pre-snap communication against them, by using certain formations and personnel that he knew would trigger specific adjustments by New England, and would then adjust the offense based on those adjustments. He also attacked New England in the same manner that teams like the Chiefs, the Eagles, and the Jaguars did - horizontally with shallow crossing routes, in order to take advantage of the lack of speed at linebacker. As I stated last week, the Patriots will continue to get burned by this until they adjust and fix this vulnerability - either schematically, or with a roster move to add more speed and coverage ability at LB.</p>
            <p>The continued struggles do not bode well against Miami, who possesses tremendous speed at WR and a RB who is capable of catching passes out of the backfield. Danny Amendola will be looking to have a big game as well, as he plays against his former team for the first time since his departure. He is exactly the type of receiver who can cause problems for the New England defense - he has the ability to create separation on short crossing routes, he's quick, runs crisp routes, and can generate yards after catch. Albert Wilson and Jakeem Grant have looked good, their top WR Kenny Stills has been explosive throughout the first three games. They are capable of playing small ball, but can also burn you with a big play over the top. Ryan Tannehill is what makes it all work. His accuracy and ball placement have been spot on, his timing and anticipation have been good, and he can scramble for a 1st down when he needs to.  </p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Dolphins.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Dolphins run defense</h1>
            <p>The Patriots had 89 rushing yards on 19 carries against Detroit. Those numbers don't look bad at first glance, a good portion of that came from hand offs to James White towards the end of the game when Detroit was in pass defense mode. Additionally, Detroit is ranked dead last in the league against the run. Needless to say, it was disappointing that the New England offensive line could not create more openings.</p>
            <p>The Dolphins are the 7th ranked run defense, but they suffered a big loss when they lost DE William Hayes for the season. Hayes was their best run defender. It will be interesting to see what kind of impact this has going forward. The Patriots will need to show dramatic improvement if they are to capitalize on this injury.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Dolphins.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Dolphins pass rush</h1>
            <p>William Hayes is not only Miami's best run defender, but arguably their best pass rusher as well. So this is another area where he will be greatly missed. But luckily for Miami, they have a very deep rotation of talented and diverse pass rushers. You've got guys that can get to the QB with power, and you've got guys who can get there with speed. Cameron Wake, Robert Quinn, Charles Harris, can all wreak havoc, and even Andre Branch can contribute as a rotational player. </p>
            <p>Surprisingly, New England's pass protection is one area that has held up well for the most part this season. Waddle has been the weak link, but whenever Marcus Cannon has seen the field, the line has played well. As the season goes on, Marcus Cannon should see more playing time, and the line should continue to improve as it gels.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Dolphins pass defense</h1>
            <p>Newly acquired WR Josh Gordon was inactive Sunday night in Detroit. It's unclear whether that's due to his hamstring injury, or whether it's due to the fact that he has not had enough time to digest the playbook. Whatever the case, the one thing that is clear, is that the Patriots offense desperately needs him out on the field. The WR corps of Hogan, Dorsett, and Patterson is not getting the job done. They have been incapable of creating separation with any consistency. It doesn't help that they are #3, #4, and #5 WRs who are drawing the opposition's top cornerbacks in coverage. Chris Hogan has played well as #3 WR for the team in the past, but it is clear that he does not belong in the top role. Josh Gordon's presence will be needed on Sunday, not only for his skill, but in order to draw attention away from Gronkowski, and to allow Hogan and Dorsett to draw lesser cornerbacks in coverage. James White could be a key player against Miami, whose LB corps are very weak in coverage. Expect to see a steady dose of White, as well as shallow crossers to the WRs, in order to take advantage of the liability in coverage of the Dolphins' LBs. Brady will also look to isolate Gronkowski on a LB pre-snap. Miami's secondary is fairly talented, with Xavien Howard leading the way, so the Patriots will not be looking to test them deep often.</p>
