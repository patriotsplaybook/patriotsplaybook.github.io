            <h2 id="week1">Week 2: Patriots vs Dolphins</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Dolphins running game</h1>
            <p>The Miami Dolphins are a team looked at by many as a team tanking for the #1 overall draft pick in next year's draft. They lost 59-10 to the Ravens last week and many of their players are requesting to be shipped off to other franchises. It shouldn't come as a surprise then, that the position group which requires the most chemistry - the offensive line - struggled immensely last Sunday. The Dolphins did not get to run much because they found themselves in a big hole early, but they it was quite clear that their OL had a poor showing. The team averaged only 1.2 yards per rushing attempt, and this week, they will be without starter Julien Davenport.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Patriots looked stout up front against a strong rush attack in their opener against the Steelers. They only allowed 2.5 yards per carry for a total of 32 rushing yards. They had help from their inside guys like Guy, Shelton, and Butler, as well as the linebackers. Given that the defense, especially the run defense, usually gets off to a slow start each season, it was encouraging to see such a strong performance in week 1.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Dolphins pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Miami OL struggled not only in run blocking, but pass protection as well. Ryan Fitzpatrick was constantly running for his life, as his offensive linemen were being beat on nearly every snap.</p>
            <p>The Patriots went up against what is arguably the best pass blocking unit in the league in week 1 against the Steelers, and their pass rushers had a solid showing. It wasn't a dominant performance, but given the formidable OL they were matched up against, no one expected it to be.</p>
            <p>Against the Miami offensive line, which is in disarray, expect the Patriots to have success attacking both up the A gap, as well as on the outside.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Dolphins passing game</h1>
            <p>The Patriots' secondary was dominant on Sunday night against the top passer in terms of total passing yardage in 2018. This is something we've become accustomed to since around the midway point of the 2018 season. They should put forth another stellar performance this week, against a team that is struggling mightily in all phases of the game, including their passing offense.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Dolphins run defense</h1>
            <p>The Patriots had an up and down night as far as their running attack was concerned. They averaged 3.4 yards per carry and accumulated 99 yards on the ground. Surprisingly, it was their starter, Sony Michel, who struggled, with only 0.9 yards per attempt. Rex Burkhead and James White had success running the ball, combining for 70 yards on 12 carries. The loss of Andrews prior to the start of the season, and Marcus Cannon during the game, no doubt had an effect on the inconsistency. Look for Sony Michel to have a better performance, however, it is clear that Ted Karras needs more time to develop chemistry with Brady at the center position, and Marcus Cannon's loss for this game will hurt as well.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Dolphins pass rush</h1>
            <p>Pass protection held up better than the run blocking, but as previously stated, Ted Karras needs more time to develop chemistry with his quarterback. His inconsistency led to some pressure on the inside last week, which stalled several drives.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Dolphins pass defense</h1>
            <p>After all of the drama surrounding Antonio Brown this past week, it looks like he will be on the field on Sunday. The Patriots will be going into this game with a WR corps of Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon, and Antonio Brown. This is arguably the best WR corps in the entire league. On top of that, they will have Tom Brady behind center, and Josh McDaniels devising the gameplan. Defending against this offense will be a daunting task for any team, but especially for a team that just gave up 378 passing yards and a perfect passer rating against Lamar Jackson.</p>
            <p>Antonio Brown is by far the most physically gifted and talented WR Brady has played with since Moss, and he is the most complete WR currently playing the game. His mere presence alone will open things up for Edelman and Gordon, as well as for the running backs, who the Patriots love to use in the passing game.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
