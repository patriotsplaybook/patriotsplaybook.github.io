            <h2 id="week1">Week 5: Patriots vs Redskins</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Redskins running game</h1>
            <p>The running game is an important aspect of coach Jay Gruden's offensive scheme, which would explain why their entire offense has struggled this season. The Redskins average fewer than 3 yards per carry and fewer than 50 yards per game. Their offensive line as well as running backs have all struggled.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Patriots are ranked number two in the run, although the Bills had a strong day running the ball against them in the absence of Hightower. Nevertheless, the Patriots front should dominate in this matchup.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Redskins pass protection</h1>
            <p>Washington's pass protection hasn't been much better than their run blocking. They've failed to provide suitable protection for their quarterbacks, and this does not bode well for them against one of the top pass rushing units in the league.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Redskins passing game</h1>
            <p>The Redskins are a West Coast offense who like quick passes, and they will run to set up their deep passes off of play action. However, given the futility of their run game, their deep passing attack hasn't been very consistent. They've had some good showings against teams like the Eagles, who have a very poor secondary, but they should struggle in that area against a New England team that has made opponents pay when they attempt to go deep on them.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Redskins run defense</h1>
            <p>The Patriots have struggled in the ground game in 2019 due to injuries along the offensive line and Sony Michel's slow start. Rex Burkhead, who has been the team's most consistent runner, is ruled out. However, against a team ranked in the bottom 5 in terms of run defense, this is a good opportunity for the Patriots to get their running game going.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Redskins pass rush</h1>
            <p>New England's pass blocking has been better than their run blocking for the most part this season, but last week was a subpar performance for this unit. Brady was pressured a lot, which threw the passing attack off. This should be a bounce back week for the offensive line, as they go up against a lackluster pass rush.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Redskins pass defense</h1>
            <p>New England's passing offense ran into an elite defense which has been a bad matchup for them over the last 5 games last week. Their receivers had trouble finding separation and as a result, they had a rough time trying to move the ball. This week, Josh Gordon has been completely removed from the injury report, and Julian is two weeks removed from his injury. The receivers should be healthier, and they will be facing a much weaker defense than they did last week. They should be able to get back into the groove.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
