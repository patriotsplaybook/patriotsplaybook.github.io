            <h2 id="week1">Week 17: Dolphins vs Patriots</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Dolphins running game</h1>
            <p>Much like earlier in the season, prior to the week 2 meeting between these two squads, Miami's offensive line is a major weakness for the team. Their 32nd ranked run defense has been largely a result of the OL consistently failing to get off their blocks and creating running lanes.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Patriots have been solid against the run this season. Lawrence Guy is coming off a big performance on the inside against a very dangerous running attack last week, and this unit looks to be playing very well down the stretch, with the exception of a few big plays against the Bengals a couple of weeks ago.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Dolphins pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Miami OL struggled not only in run blocking, but pass protection as well. Ryan Fitzpatrick has been constantly running for his life, as his offensive linemen are getting beat frequently. Miami has allowed the most QB hits of any team this season..</p>
            <p>Against the Miami offensive line, which is in disarray, expect the Patriots to have success attacking both up the A gap, as well as on the outside.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Dolphins passing game</h1>
            <p>The Patriots' secondary has been dominant in 2019. This is something we've become accustomed to since around the midway point of the 2018 season. They should put forth another stellar performance this week, despite Ryan Fitzpatrick's recent success passing the ball.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Dolphins run defense</h1>
            <p>The Patriots had an up and down season as far as their running attack was concerned. However, their ground attack is heating up at the right time. The offensive line is playing very well as a unit, Elandon Roberts is getting better each week at fullback, and Michel, Burkhead, and White are all running the ball well.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Dolphins pass rush</h1>
            <p>Pass protection has been very stout for the Patriots since Wynn's return, and it continues to get better each week.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Dolphins pass defense</h1>
            <p>The passing game for the Patriots has been the center of a lot of criticism over the last couple of months, and rightfully so. Injuries to Tom Brady, the receivers, and offensive line have led to a very poor air attack for New England over that stretch. Luckily, it looks like the team is getting healthy at the right time. Tom Brady was very efficient against arguably the second best defense in the league last week, Julian Edelman looked like a force, N'Keal Harry was utilized much better by Josh McDaniels, and provided another dimension for this offense, and they had contributions from White and Meyers, too. They have an opportuntiy to continue this momentum this week, against a weak Miami back end.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
