            <h2 id="week1">Week 13: Patriots vs Texans</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Texans running game</h1>
            <p>The Texans new and improved running attack will be a key ingredient for them on Sunday night. Carlos Hyde, Duke Johnson, and even QB Deshaun Watson, have the potential to gash opposing defenses on the ground. Their offensive line has been solid, but fairly inconsistent. If they are to win the game, they will need the OL to bring its A game in the run blocking department, to allow their talented runners to break free.</p>
            <p>The Patriots' run defense ranks in the top 10 this season. They've had some trouble against 3 of the top running attacks in the league (Ravens, Bills, and Browns) but for the most part, they have done fine job of stay in their lanes and setting the edge. With the team being hit by the flu this week, allowing long drives by Houston's offense will drain their energy more so than usual, which could be disastrous.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Texans pass protection</h1>
            <p>Watson has been pressured more than all but 6 QBs in the NFL in 2019. Houston's pass protection has been a problem, especially rookies RT Tytus Howard and LG Max Scharping. Watson's tendency to hold on to the ball for too long has also contributed to this.</p>
            <p>New England's pass rush has been very strong, and they should have an advantage in this match up. Look for them to target the rookies and to pressure Watson from both the inside and the edge.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Texans passing game</h1>
            <p>The Texans have a potent passing attack, and it begins with QB Deshaun Watson. A very accurate and athletic passer with a strong throwing arm. He has two very dangerous weapons who can make big plays on the perimeter in DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller.</p>
            <p>The Patriots boast the best secondary in the league, and the team will lean on that elite unit on Sunday night. With two dangerous deep threats on the opposing offense, you can expect to see New England with two deep safeties, be it Cover 2 zone or Cover 2 man. Given that they are predominately a man coverage team, and that Watson has performed worse against man than zone this season, the Patriots will give the Texans a heavy dose of tight man to man coverage.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Texans run defense</h1>
            <p>Houston runs a 3-4 front with vert big and physical players in their front 7. They have a stout run defense that is tough to penetrate up the middle. However, given their size, they lack the speed to keep up against teams that attack them sideline to sideline.</p>
            <p>Isaiah Wynn's return last week seemed to give the Patriots a boost in the run game. He looked good run blocking and creating lanes for the RBs. The Patriots need to run towards the edges of Houston's defense, in order to make those big defenders run from sideline to sideline.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Texans pass rush</h1>
            <p>While New England's run blocking looked better, the pass blocking continued to struggle. Brady was under constant duress, and the passing game struggled as a result. The Texans haven't shown an ability to generate a consistent pass rush, but if the Patriots offensive line continues to play like it has, they should be able to get to Tom Brady.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Texans.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Texans pass defense</h1>
            <p>Houston will be under-manned in the secondary, and the Patriots may be under-manned in their receiving corps. Sanu and Dorsett are likely to play, but the question is, how healthy will they be? Both are coming off injuries, and Julian Edelman has been on the injury report as well.</p>
            <p>The Texans have been playing a lot of zone coverage lately. Ideally, they would like to play more man coverage against Brady and his receivers, but they may not have the players to hold up in man to man.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
