            <h2 id="week1">Week 11: Patriots vs Eagles</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Eagles running game</h1>
            <p>The Eagles have had a middle of the pack running attack in 2019, but schematically, they pose some issues for New England. The Eagles run a lot of misdirection and use a lot of motion - two issues that have the Patriots trouble in Super Bowl 52. They also use the RPO more than any team other than the Chiefs, and they like to employ a zone blocking scheme. The Patriots' run defense, and defense as a whole, is much better than it was that night, but this style of offense has still given them trouble from time to time. The Eagles offensive line has performed well, so the defensive front of the Patriots will have its hands full.</p>
            <p>The Patriots have struggled against the run in their last two games against the Browns and Ravens. They will have to be on their A game against a team that poses some schematic and matchup issues, otherwise, it could be another tough day for them on the road in front of a rowdy crowd.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Eagles</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Eagles pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Eagles' offensive line has been a premier unit ever since they won the Super Bowl a couple of years ago. It continues to be a unit that can completely take over a game. If there is a weakness, it's on the left side with Seumalo and Dillard, but they have been solid, too, more often than not. The Patriots will have to be creative with their pass rush schemes, and the players will have to execute flawlessly to have success against an elite pass blocking unit.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Eagles passing game</h1>
            <p>The Eagles like to use a lot of mesh concepts with shallow crossers and vertical pass routes, wheel routes, play action, and RPO. It's a very well designed offense, and can cause issues for a team with a Cover 1/Cover 3 structure like New England's defense.</p>
            <p>The Eagles also like to use a lot of 12-personnel, with two tight ends on the field at once. Zach Ertz is one of the best TEs in the league, and he can be very dangerous out of the slot. The Patriots' opponents this season have had some success out of 12-personnel.</p>
            <p>Since losing Super Bowl 52 to the Eagles by allowing 41 points to the aforementioned concepts, the Patriots have made some adjustments to their man coverage to stop the shallow crossers that teams would exploit them with. Their secondary is also much stronger than it was in 2017. Hightower can still be exploited in coverage, but Jamie Collins, and to a lesser extent, Bentley, can hold up against the pass.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Eagles run defense</h1>
            <p>The Eagles have one of the best run defenses in the NFL this season. They have a very stout defensive front, and it's been very difficult for teams to penetrate it.</p>
            <p>The Patriots' running game has been very lackluster in 2019, mainly due to offensive line injuries. Shaq Mason, who was out last week, will make his return on Sunday. The interior of the line will need to hold up, because the Eagles' defensive front can wreck this game if given the chance.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Eagles.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Eagles pass rush</h1>
            <p>The Eagles' defensive front is not only dangerous against the run, but against the pass, too. Fletcher Cox is an elite pass rusher on the inside, and he can take over a game if he is not accounted for. The Eagles will be looking to generate pressure up the middle in order to get Brady off his spot.</p>
            <p>Shaq Mason's return will help this week, but the bye week may be an even bigger factor. The Patriots' OL has been banged up this season, and two weeks of rest could be just what the doctor ordered. Mason and Cannon will need to step up for the remainder of the season and play up to their potential.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Eagles pass defense</h1>
            <p>Much like New England, the Eagles also use a Cover 1/Cover 3 structure. This means that they are susceptible to the same concepts that the Patriots have been vulnerable to - in particular, shallow crossers. The problem for the Eagles is that their secondary is nowhere near the caliber of the Patriots. Their secondary can be beat on double moves, inside releases, and can be consistently beat deep.</p>
            <p>While the Patriots lost Super Bowl 52, it certainly wasn't because of their offensive output. Tom Brady set a playoff record for passing yards that night, and put up 33 points (a missed field goal and missed extra point would have made it 37.) With Mohamed Sanu getting more comfortable in the offense each week, this offense is poised to explode against a very weak pass defense.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
