            <h2 id="week1">Week 8: Browns vs Patriots</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Browns running game</h1>
            <p>The Cleveland Browns boast the second highest rushing yards per carry in the NFL in 2019. They've got a strong run blocking offensive line and a tremendous running back. Nick Chubb is one of the premier RBs in the league - a power back who also has impressive breakaway speed.</p>
            <p>The Patriots have one of the top run defenses this season, but this will be their toughest challenge on the ground. Playing in a 3-4 defense, they rely on their linebackers to make plays in both the pass rush and run defense. Their linebacking corps has been superb this season, and they will be the key in trying to limit Chubb.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Browns pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Browns' pass protection has been up and down in 2019, and Baker Mayfield has been visibly uncomfortable in the pocket as a result. Mayfield has also been known to hold on to the ball too long, which has also contributed to the number of hits he has absorbed.</p>
            <p>The Patriots have one of the better pass rushes in the league. Their creativity and their rotation of pass rushers, has allowed them to harass opposing QBs and forcing them into errors. They have an opportunity to wreak havoc against an underperforming OL and a QB who can be rattled.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Browns passing game</h1>
            <p>Cleveland's passing attack, despite featuring two incredibly talented WRs in Odell Beckham Jr and Jarvis Landry, has struggled this season. Most of their issues have been due to the aforementioned pass blocking woes, but Baker Mayfield is having a worse season than he did in 2018.</p>
            <p>The Browns run an Air Raid offense, and Freddie Kitchens loves vertical pass concepts. However, one of their better passing performances came when they focused more on the quick and short/intermediate passes.</p>
            <p>New England's defense continues to play at an historically great level, especially their secondary. All of their defensive backs have been game breakers this season, showing tight and disciplined coverage, and the ability to intercept passes almost at will. The Patriots play a lot of Cover 1 and Cover 3, but they are a gameplan defense, and will adjust their scheme accordingly. In the past, when they've played an offense with two dangerous WRs, they've played a lot of Cover 2 in order to give their corners a lot of safety help.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Browns run defense</h1>
            <p>The Browns have one of the worst run defenses in the league this season, statistically. Their front 7 have had issues getting off blocks and have shown poor gap discipline.</p>
            <p>After missing several games, Rex Burkhead is expected to play. He's been their most efficient running back in 2019, and against a weak run defense, he should be a key weapon. Look for the Patriots to try to get Sony Michel back on track as well by feeding him early and often.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Browns pass rush</h1>
            <p>The Browns' pass rush has been very strong through the first 7 weeks. They've got 4 very capable pass rushers up front, and Myles Garrett in particular has been nearly unstoppable.</p>
            <p>The Patriots will have their hands full trying to limit this pass rush. Expect some max protection, play action, and a lot of quick throws and screens.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Browns pass defense</h1>
            <p>The Patriots acquired Mohamed Sanu for a 2nd round draft pick this week to give a boost to their passing attack. Josh Gordon was placed on IR, and will likely not return to the team, even when he is eligible to come back. </p>
            <p>Sanu brings size, physicality, football intelligence, and the ability to play in the slot and outside. With Sanu, the Patriots now have two elite WRs who can work the middle of the field. Sanu is also a superb blocker for a WR.</p>
            <p>The Browns are allowing opposing QBs to complete 68% of their passes against them for 7.6 yards per attempt. They haven't been able to generate many turnovers. This does not bode well against the Patriots, who will be content throwing short and quick passes all game long in order to move the chains. With Edelman and Sanu working the middle of the field, White catching passes out of the backfield, and Dorsett occasionally threatening deep, this will be too much for the Browns to contend with.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
