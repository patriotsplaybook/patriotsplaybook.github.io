            <h2 id="week1">Week 12: Patriots vs Cowboys</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots run defense vs Cowboys running game</h1>
            <p>The Dallas Cowboys’ running game has been a top 10 unit in the NFL in 2019. Scheme wise, they are a more traditional and predictable offense than the Baltimore Ravens, who gave the Patriots a lot of problems in the running game. However, the Patriots have not always fared well against mobile QBs like Dak Prescott.</p>
            <p>The Patriots’ run defense looked a lot better last week against a solid running attack on the road. The mobility of Prescott could pose some issues for them, and so could star EB Ezekiel Elliot. </p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Cowboys</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass rush vs Cowboys pass protection</h1>
            <p>The Cowboys’ offensive line has been very stout in pass protection this season, which is a key reason behind their ranking as the best passing offense in the NFL. They have given Dak a lot of time to scan the field and dissect opposing offenses. </p>
            <p>The Patriots, meanwhile, continue to have one of the best pass rushing units in the league. They are successful blitzing as well as rushing with only 4 guys. They are very versatile and can get pressure from anywhere, and they have some very creative pass rush schemes. This should be an even battle between two top notch units, with both sides making plays.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass defense vs Cowboys passing game</h1>
            <p>The Cowboys have the #1 ranked passing attack in the league. Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup, and Randall Cobb have all played well this season. Elliot has contributed in the passing game as well. Their best player, however, has been Dak Prescott. He has been given a lot of time and protection by the OL, and has been able to pick defenses apart.</p>
            <p>New offensive coordinator Kellen Moore has designed an offense that has been easy for Dak to grasp and that stresses opposing defenses. He also loves to use a lot of pre-snap motion to allow Dak to read the defense and to exploit match ups.</p>
            <p>The Patriots pass defense has been dominant in 2019. They have high level talent across the secondary, and a very fast and athletic LB in Jamie Collins who can also cover. Expect Gilmore to be matched up on Cooper, who has been the Cowboys’ most dangerous weapon. Jonathan Jones will likely take Cobb in the slot, and either JC Jackson or Jason McCourty on Michael Gallup.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots running game vs Cowboys run defense</h1>
            <p>Dallas’ run defense has given up over 100 rushing yards in 7 of their 10 games this season. They’ve had some issues defending the run, and in turn, this has worn their defense out throughout games, making them susceptible to giving up key plays.</p>
            <p>If there is one week where New England can get their running game going, it’s this week. The return of LT Isaiah Wynn is huge for the team. He looked good in the few snaps that he has played this season, and the team desperately needs him back on the offensive line.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots pass protection vs Cowboys pass rush</h1>
            <p>Wynn should help shore up the pass protection as well, which has been another weakness of this offense. The Cowboys’ pass rush seems to have been improved slightly with the addition of former Patriot Michael Bennett, but Wynn’s presence and home field advantage will be the key here.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Patriots.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Patriots passing game vs Cowboys pass defense</h1>
            <p>The Cowboys pass defense, albeit not a dominant unit, has been better than their running defense. With New England’s depleted WR corps, they may have a difficult time moving the ball through the air. It will take some creativity from Josh McDaniels to get this passing attack going.</p>
            <p>Match-up edge: Even.</p>
